            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>As he notes in his new book, <i>Woodson From The Streets: my life before rescue</i> Woodson struggled finding his forever home.
                As a kitten, he spent a short time as a family cat until he snuck out and got lost. His world was about to turn upside down. After a
                month ot two of living off the land as a feral cat, Woodson was picked up by kind strangers and taken to the Humane Society. There, 
                he spent almost his entire day in a small cage, only big enough for him and his litter box. He lived here for 8 months, watching cats all
                around him be adopted and go home with their new families'. This was a hard time for Woodson. Luckily, a girl named Emma came into
                the shelter looking to adopt the kitty who had been at the shelter the longest. Poor Woodson had been in the shelter longer than any 
                of the other cats, but that meant he got to go home with Emma!!! The first night they lived together, Woodson joined her on the foot of
                her bed when it was time to sleep. Soon, he crawled up on her chest and purred while Emma pet him. From this moment, they both knew
                they had found their home together.</p>

            <h2>Rise to Fame</h2>
                <p>One random night, Emma introduced Woodson to his favorite toy of all time - a crumpled up <i>receipt</i>. Upon crumpling up
                the seat, Emma realized that Woodson was at attention, eyes locked on the target. She threw it and off he went! Soon he even learned
                to bring it back. Now this was <i>professional fetch</i>, and Emma had never seen a cat do this before. She snapped a quick video of Woodson
                jumping up in the air to catch the ball and he bopped it right back to her!!! After posting this to twitter, Woodson soon went viral.
                The social media phenomenon peaked when producers of NBC's <i>The Today Show</i>reached out to invite Woodson on the show for an interview.</p>
