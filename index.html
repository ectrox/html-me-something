        <h1>Written by Woodson Troxell, cat</h1>
        <h2>chapter one: my first family</h2>
            <p>
                My earliest memories come from the first family that adopted me. As a kitten, they taught me how to be a cat. They played with me,
                fed me, and MOST importantly, loved on me!!!!! My favorite activity there was looking out the window for hours and hours on end.
                The sounds of birds and the scurrying of squirrels were fascinating to me. There were times I wanted to run away, especially when they sprayed me with water just for filing my nails!! 
                Regardless of the water and the no climbing on top of the cabinets rule.. I never wanted what was about to happen next.

        <h2>chapter two: my [almost] fatal mistake</h2>
            <p>
                I remember that day like it was yesterday... It's been four years now. The warm sun was glistening over me when it happened.
                Swoosshhhh.. the back door slides open and I see my shot. I just wanted a taste of the outdoors. I sprang up, and through the legs of 
                my human I scurried. What a rush the first minute was.. then I realized how wrong I was. The sounds were coming from everywhere, and
                there were so many smells I didn't know what to do! I ran back in the direction of the door... or so I thought. I was lost...

        <h2>chpater three: the survival</h2>
            <p>
                The first month wasn't so easy. It seemed like cold and rainy nights were on replay. But before long I started to get the hang of things.
                Within weeks I felt like a natural born feral cat!! Hunting became my favorite part of the day.
                The long blades of grass surrounded me as I stalked my prey. The grass swaying with the breeze tickled my whiskers.
                I felt the chill of autumn air on my exquisite brindle coat. I get ready to pounce... my sights are focused and then BAM!
                At just the right moment, I push myself into the air with all the force my back legs can muster. With my arms stretched 
                out and claws ready to snatch my next meal I am elated! &quot;This whole wild cat thing isn't so bad,&quot; I thought to myself.
