        <h1>Woodson From the Streets: life before my rescue</h1>
        <h1>Written by Woodson Troxell, cat</h1>
        <h2>chapter one: my first family</h2>
            <p>
                My earliest memories come from the first family that adopted me. As a kitten, they taught me how to be a cat. They played with me,
                fed me, and MOST importantly, loved on me!!!!! My favorite activity there was looking out the window for hours and hours on end.
                The sounds of birds and the scurrying of squirrels were fascinating to me. There were times I wanted to run away, especially when they sprayed me with water just for filing my nails!! 
                Regardless of the water and the no climbing on top of the cabinets rule.. I never wanted what was about to happen next.

        <h2>chapter two: my [almost] fatal mistake</h2>
            <p>
                I remember that day like it was yesterday... It's been four years now
            </p>
            <p>
                The long blades of grass surrounded me as I stalked my prey. The grass swaying with the breeze tickled my whiskers.
                I felt the chill of autumn air on my exquisite brindle coat. I get ready to pounce... my sights are focused and then BAM!
                At just the right moment, I push myself into the air with all the force my back legs can muster. With my arms stretched 
                out and claws ready to snatch my next meal I am elated! This whole wild cat thing isn't so bad, I thought to myself.
